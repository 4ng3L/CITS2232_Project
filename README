Hi all, this is the README for our current project status, which will be updated
as things progress.

PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU LOG CHANGES TO THE CODE THAT YOU MAKE.
When you do decide to commit something, please try your best to use
git commit -m "A concise, informative message about the changes you made"

COMMIT OFTEN.
Keep on logging the changes made! It will make our development logs look more
pretty, and more awesome, but it will mean we have more versions of code we
can go back to in the event we want to change something.

PULL OFTEN.
When you begin your session of work, pull the latest version from the
repositories, and check the development log using
git log
so that you can see what changes any other group members have made.

DON'T PUSH TOO OFTEN...
Pushing will put stuff upstream. That might not necessarily be good. Start off
by committing a lot of times to keep a track of what you've done, but push
upstream when you're confident that your work is good.
